# LamBox

LamBox is a project aimed at helping the visually impaired with medical treatment.

It connects 3 important sides, the visually impaired, doctors and pharmacies. Each of these sides has a mobile application that allows them to communicate with each other.

- [LamBox Client](https://github.com/LeomaiaJr/LamBox-Client) - A mobile application that allows the visually impaired to schedule appointments with doctors and find the nearest pharmacies, using voice recognition.
- [LamBox Doc](https://github.com/LeomaiaJr/LamBox-Doc) - A mobile application that allows doctors to manage their appointments, and check the status of their patients.
- [LamBox Pharmacy](https://github.com/LeomaiaJr/LamBox-Pharm) - A mobile application that allows pharmacies to manage their stock and patients.

All apps are developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for the backend.

Project developed during **PROJETE â€“ Technological Projects Fair of Francisco Moreira da Costa Technical School of Electronics**, during the second year (2020) of the System Development Technical Course.
